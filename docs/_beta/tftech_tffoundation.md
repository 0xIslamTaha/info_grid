### What is the TFF exchange strategy?

TFF exchange needs to read TFT exchange.  It's the ThreeFold Token that is traded on an exchange.  A document describing the token workings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y79Jkc90e13wsUSJ-oYF7Nyb5PhkwdVci3nZcpJh468/edit#heading=h.96o9rtovxrml).  The TFT is currently tradable on 2 exchanges and there is a plan for 2019 to be traded on coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges globaly.  In order to make this possible TF Tech will create an ERC20 token that allows it to be traded on coinbase (and other exchanges) because they are ERC20 token compatible.  Some materials on this announcement can be found here:

Next to the strategy to be trading on public but central exchanges TF Tech is working on creating and launching a distributed exchange.  The dostrinbuted exchange provides anyone thats wants to trade with a personal order book (managed by a 3bot) that collects information on the TF Grid about people selling and wanting to purchase TFT's.  Information is exchanged by a peer-to-peer mechanism where everyone partaking will create their own personal orderbook.  Inter crypto settlement will happen by using [atomic swaps](https://hackernoon.com/atomic-swaps-simply-explained-how-to-swap-cryptocurrencies-without-a-middleman-6cd29680c32e)

### How does 3BOT fit into the ecosystem?

3BOT is a software template which can be use to perform many different tasks.
 - It us used to run a distributed exchange for a number of cryptocurrencies.
 - It is used to manage and share personal information to other 3BOTs in the system.
 - It is used for finding, agreeing and contracting storage and compute capacity.
 - It us used to deploy, operate and maintain IT architectures.

These are a number of the main tasks of the 3BOT at grid launch - it will be given a lot more tasks during the expansion and lifetime of the grid.

### What are the applications that do and don’t run on our grid? 

There are a number of technoical features that TFTech has enabled and/or build into the grid based on the generic direction IT is taking globally.  A conscious dicision is made to _not_ support virtual machine workloads as this is seen as old / currenct technology - certainly not the technology that will fuel the future of IT.  Various research instituion and firm have reports on how containerised technology is the future for future IT workloads on the internet of things.



### Which use cases to look out for? 

### Which sort of developers?

### What exactly will we have ready for the January launch and by when?

### Who are our competitors? (GIG? Vapor.io? Redhat? Docker?)

### Are we a docker? Or can someone build docker on top of us?

### What’s the difference between Zero-Bot & 3Bot? 

### Is TF Tech looking for clients? If so, what profile? What is our value proposition? What products do we offer?

### Do we need a separate wiki for TF Tech?
