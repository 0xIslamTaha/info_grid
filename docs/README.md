# ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid)

![](images/world.png)

The ThreeFold Grid is a build by collective of independent people that together create a pool of Internet compute and storage capacity that fuels a crypto currency token economy resulting in a very stable currency that is used but sell and buy this capacity and many other items in the near future.

This WIKI presents the basic information required to participate in this grid in a number of different roles.  Examples roles are:
- **a farmer**:  these are the people that actually put forward investments to build and operate this Internet capacity pool.  Farmers purchase and operate compute and storage hardware that they list on the TF Grid.
- **a cooperative**: this is an organisation that performs most of the logistical and operational task for the actual farming activity in function of farmers that are looking for an investment only model to participate.
- **a developer**: these are people that build services and applications that run on the TF Grid.
- **a customer**:  customer are using applications on the TF Grid and consume TF Grid resources for which they pay a number of TF tokens.
