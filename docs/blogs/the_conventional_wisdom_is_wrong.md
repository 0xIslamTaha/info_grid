## Myths: The conventional wisdom about Cloud Computing is wrong

### Hyper scale data centers are by design more efficient

There are advantages in building large scale datacenters like  economies of scale and shear bulk buying power  compared to small ones but these are not as big as people think. The average cost per rack in a hyperscale datacenter is 20-35K USD including all energy & safety systems. The cost of the hardware per rack is around the  200-300k USD mark.

What is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and therefore highly concentrated or dense brings complexity and a specific set of problems to deal with. This adds resource requirements like investment, operational costs, knowledge and people.

This is often ignored or waved aside because solving complexities like this have become an industry in itself.  IT is in peoples nature to solve challenges and develop new way to deal with challenges.  But let's use those resources to solve real problems, not self invented challenges.

In reality keeping things simple & small is much more cost effective than a big complex environment.  So creating a hyperscale datacenter presents a very interesting challenge and there are specialist companies to help build and solve problems along the way but it is not the most cost effective way to deliver datacenter services.


### Big data centers can be made green and this is super important

If you throw in all assets needed to build a big data center - land, real estate and all required hardware, power and staff- it leaves a huge carbon footprint.   Power a datacenter with wind, hydro or solar power and use technology to improve the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of a datacenter helps to reduce the overall carbon footprint.  This is the strategy that most datacenter operators have adopted to decrease their carbon footprint and write about this in their corporate social responsibility.

A 20% reduction in the PUE factor of a datacenter sounds like big deal but it's still an improvement in the overhead power consumption.  Improvements are mostly sought and found in the actual cooling technology of a datacenter or by sourcing zero carbon footprint power sources.  What is hardly ever looked it is the actual power consumed by the equipment that runs the IT workloads inside these datacenter.  Actual servers, storage chassis, physical disks, switch farms and tape libraries.

These devices make up 100% it the real carbon footprint of a datacenter while the PUE only speaks about the overhead power consumption to cool the facility, to open and close the doors of the facility and the security systems that keep the bad people out and the good people in.

The real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual IT capacity to run the workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks and storage cabinets. Working on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of 1000% and lead to 10 times more power efficiency. More info see this blog

### Redundant systems have a better uptime?

This is how all of us (of age ;-) have been raised.  Systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability.  And to be honest if you look at it for a minutes this seems to make a lot of sense….  if you are looking at it through IT tainted glasses.  But translate this to the non IT World: Simple example:  

In order to make your car more reliable we add redundancy as we do in IT.  So for the risk of having a puncture we add one extra tyre for all the tyres we use continuously.  This adds 4 extra tyres to the car.  Then a decision needs to be made:  Do we put those tyres in a structure where they are always running along the primary tyres or do we chose not to have them "online" all the time and wearing and tearing as the primary tyres?  
To have them online continuously is inefficient and wasteful and therefore we need to built a very complicated structure that puts the tyres on the road the second (more accurate microsecond) that the car detects a tyre puncture.  To build this system which adds high availability to a car is definitely an engineering challenge that would keep a (large) number of engineers (electronic, hydraulic, mechanical and computer) busy for awhile and I am sure that all of them would come up with a working solution.  But…..

This solution would add a lot of complexity, would change the the look and feel of a car completely, would add a lot of unnecessary petrol to overcome the extra drag and so and so on.  Also would you feel comfortable to run this car down the motorway at 100 miles an hour and have to risk of it putting down four extra tyres?  I don't think so and in reality this has not been done for mainstream transportation - for certain speciality vehicles we have invented tyres that cannot deflated, thereby solving the issue in the simplest possible manner.  Solve the root cause.

The IT industry has gone mental with the concept of everything needs to be built and expanded to create redundancy, it forgot somehow to look at root causes which helped spawning a whole new industry of itself, that obviously want to keep themselves in the business of creating complicated and expensive redundant system.  A self fulfilling prophecy  But has it actually made IT system more reliable?

### Big companies with a certain track record will know better how to optimize, they have more people…

At first sight this sounds logical but still if we look at the IT landscape today 90%+ of innovation in IT is done by small startups. The big legacy IT companies have a huge heritage they hardly can overcome. They are locked in old infrastructure designs and after a while the build out of the infrastructure becomes the brake for their business. Real innovation dies a slows death and in comes the pain killer approach.

When companies come of size red tape enters the structure and innovation comes to a halt.  Maintaining the status quo operationally, building brand, improving the bottom line are the new tactical goals that are redefined every financial year.  Innovation and R&D budgets shrink and the technology marginally improves to be able to have annual announcements.

Obviously this is a very negative view of large established companies, but to a degree we all recognise the difficulties to achieve real change in such large entreprises.  On the contrary small startup of even scale up companies are agile, have an overall

The innovation to overcome these hurdles is mostly blocked internally by the established power houses. Startups on the other hand are more keen to develop new things and have no history to deal with.
