##Token generation rules for Certified and DIY hardware

###A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:


* **Farming Tokens:** as a result of connecting IT hardware to the internet, ThreeFold tokens are generated

* **Cultivation Tokens:** as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised by ThreeFold Grid Capacity users


###Three types of farmers:



* **Cooperative Farmers:** purchase a range of services from a ThreeFold Cooperative up to and including, ThreeFold Certified Hardware, installation, location, power and connectivity

* **Individual Farmers:** create certified ThreeFold Capacity using ThreeFold Certified Hardware but complete their own installation, and providing their own location, power and connectivity

* **DIY Farmers:** who create uncertified ThreeFold Capacity using their own choice of hardware (incertified hardware)



###Certified vs. DIY hardware

* **Certified Hardware:**
All hardware which is certified. With being certified the security of the hardware and the generated TF capacity is way higher.
((((((((((((((((Weynand)))))))))))))))

* **DIY Hardware:**
All Hardware which is not certified

###Token generation rules until December 31st 2018:
-
There will be no distinction between DIY and certified hardware



|                    | Farming TFTs | Cultivation TFTs |
| ------------------ | ---------------| ------------------ |
| Certified Hardware | 1/60th of the calculated farming TFTs per month | TF Grid not live -> no cultivation Tokens, no fees |
| DIY Hardware | 1/60th of the calculated farming TFTs per month | TF Grid not live -> no cultivation Tokens, no fees |




###Token generation rules after January 1st 2019:
There will be no distinction between DIY and certified hardware


|                    | Farming TFTs | Cultivation TFTs |
| ------------------ | ---------------| ------------------ |
| Certified Hardware | 1/60th of the calculated farming TFTs per month | TFTs from TF capacity sales minus 10% to TF Tech*, minus 10% for TF Foundation |
| DIY Hardware | after 30% of capacity is sold: 1/60th of the calculated farming TFTs per month |TFTs from TF capacity sales minus 10% for TF Foundation |

 *License fee to TF Tech


 ###Farming TFTs calculation rules


 For Certified and DIY hardware the difficulty factor is set at 8.

*************************##########################********************

Text from last weeks meeting with redstars:
Today all capacity = DIY farming, no fees for 2018
10% goes to TFTech as part of smart contract (starts 2019)
Means we get a wallet with an estimated 4-5m USD for current capacity over 5Y.
TFTech needs to put starting capital in crypto, no tax impact as long as losses, after 25%.
Reservation = transaction with the right amount to wallet which runs on TF Node,
Auto 10% to TFTech for all existing capacity until end of year. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Certified capacity (starting Jan 19)
TF Nodes = BIOS, secure boot (make sure farmers cannot get inside HW)
TF Nodes host a wallet & wallet private key provided by us.
Farmer owns TF Node, wallet gives 10% to us -> License fee
Farmer (or distri, var in between) needs to sign contract with TF-Tech to agree to pay license by means of digital currency or cash however they prefer.

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:

Farmed Tokens: as a result of connecting IT hardware to the internet, ThreeFold tokens are generated
Cultivated Tokens: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised by ThreeFold Grid Capacity users
This document describes how Farming Tokens are issued in more detail.

Goal

TFTs are backed by internet capacity
Internet capacity needs to be good enough
Reliable hardware (good enough hard disks and SSDs, because data is stored on them)
Uptime needs to be good enough
Internet capacity needs to be everywhere (promote distribution)
Avoid abuse, people trying to cheat the system, e.g. dirty farming, or people who just add capacity to get tokens with no intent to sell capacity
Farmer types

(Three types of farmers:

Cooperative Farmers: purchase a range of services from a ThreeFold Cooperative up to and including, ThreeFold Certified Hardware, installation, location, power and connectivity
Individual Farmers: create certified ThreeFold Capacity using ThreeFold Certified Hardware but complete their own installation, and providing their own location, power and connectivity
DIY Farmers: who create uncertified ThreeFold Capacity using their own choice of hardware)

Certified Capacity

Definition of ThreeFold Capacity
Uptime
Farmer defines an uptime guarantee appropriate for their production environment (connectivity, housing, power)
Uptime history of the Farmer's Farming Pool is listed on the TF Chain

Hardware components:
TF Certified Hardware
TF Certified Hardware is supplied by ThreeFold Certified Cooperatives. ThreeFold Certified Cooperatives are accredited by the ThreeFold foundation because they have proven they are compliant with the Certified Coop rules <>
Farmed and Cultivated Tokens
Amount of Farmed Tokens see rules of Creation of TFTs
For Certified Hardware the difficulty level is currently set at 8. The difficulty level is managed by the Guardians of the ThreeFold Foundation.
Because Certified Hardware is being used, Farmed Tokens are released by the TF Chain immediately. This means the Farmer has access to the tokens and can do with them what they want.
Cultivated Tokens are available immediately after capacity has been utilized.

Uncertified Capacity

Definition of ThreeFold Capacity
Uptime requirements
Farmer defines an uptime guarantee appropriate for their production environment (connectivity, housing, power)
Uptime history of the Farmer's Farming Pool is listed on the TF Chain
Hardware requirements
Any type of hardware can be used. This hardware can be new or refurbished.
Farming of tokens
For amount of tokens generated, see rules of Creation of TFTs
For Uncertified Hardware the difficulty level is currently set at 8, currently the same as for Certified Hardware. The difficulty level is managed by the Guardians of the ThreeFold Foundation.
Because Uncertified Hardware is being used, Farmed Tokens are released by the TF Chain from the moment the Farming Pool of the Farmer has more than 30% utilization. Please note: Farmed Tokens are accumulated from the moment of connection, the 30% rule is to ensure that Farmers list usable capacity.
Cultivated Tokens are available immediately after capacity has been utilized.
Existing Cooperatives active today!

You can become a TF Farmer today by using existing TF Cooperatives.

See inital cooperative directory
You can be part of these cooperatives, buy your hardware and be your own farmer. Please contact them for specific details. Each cooperative has their own commercial offerings to allow you to become a farmer starting today.

Do you want to create your own cooperative, please contact the ThreeFold Foundation, we can help you how to get started.

How to become a TF Farmer (without cooperative)

Do you want to become your own TF Farmer, please become part of our early adopter program and we get you initiated in everything you need to know to be most successful as a TF Farmer. We will start mid April with online sessions. Before June 1 any TF Farmer hardware will be connected to our testnet (is our TF Grid made for testing purposes), this way your hardware capacity can be validated.

Your TF Hardware pool will be registered in the official TF Chain starting June 1.

The ThreeFold Foundation will also be organizing technical sessions for people who want to learn how to use the capacity of the TF Grid in most optimal way. This will happen face to face as well as online.

Farmer registration rules during June-July 2018

During the startup period of the TF Grid we start with predefined register token pricing (till end July 2018). These rules are registered in the TF Chain.

Important: TF token pricing in public market can be different.

Token generation rules see this link
TFT token price used for registration = US $0.1
Also see Capacity measurement here below
During this startup period the sales prices of SU/CU are fixed:
Farming Pool Type	Compute Unit CU	Storage Unit SU
Unmanaged Refurb	USD 10	USD 10
Unmanaged New	USD 12	USD 12
Managed	USD 20	USD 12
Capacity Measurements

Zero-OS measures Resource Units and registers this in the TF Chain.

Unit type	Description	Code
core unit	1 logical core (hyper-threaded core)	CRU
mem unit	1 GB mem	MRU
hd unit	1 GB raw storage capacity	HRU
ssd unit	1 GB	raw storage capacity	SRU
Cloud Unit capacity is calculated as follows:

Cloud unit type	Calculation	Description
1 SU	#HRU / 1090	nr of HRU (GB HD capacity) / 1093
1 SU	#SRU / 135	nr of SRU (SSD HD capacity) / 135
1 CU	min(#CRU,#MRU/4,#SRU/20) * 0.9	minimum of nr of cores, mem /4 and min requirement of 20 GB SSD per CU, with 10% overhead
The 1.09 and 135 are calculated as follows (for details see following [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsrG_bvrPl1I4q6FLScLwZDfe5HJ_DWOfY9RjZ8fZI4/edit#gid=75337142

1090 = (70% Archive Capacity + 30% NAS Capacity) / 0.75
0.75 is overhead for redundancy and some unused storage capacity
135 = 50% temp ssd capacity + 40% std ssd capacity which is redundant + 10% high performance ssd capacity / 0.6
0.6 is estimate of unused SSD capacity, what will not be used in future
These conversion parameters can be redefined together with difficulty level by 60% majority vote of ThreeFold Ambassadors.

These rules are running as smart apps inside our TF Chain.

A sheet exists to help you simulate your capacity and token creation, please contact the TF Foundation for help. Link of this spreadsheet is here

Imposed retrospectively = time of registration counts

At registration of the capacity the following parameters are registered:

Name	Description
tokens	tokens rewarded per 30 days is result of calculation and most important param
token price	token price at the moment of registration
sales price cloud units	sales price of CU & SU for chosen Farming Pool Type at registration
resource conversion units	conversion units from resource to cloud units (1090, 135, ...)
uptime = SLA	only relevant for managed Resource Pool, min required uptime (for other capacity = 99.5%)
date	registration date
min percent utilization	minimum utilization degree before farming tokens are rewarded
period duration	fixed on 30 days
farming periods	nr of periods the farming tokens are rewarded
farming pool size	in CU/SU and CRU/MRU/HRU/SRU
Some of above parameters are fixed & pre-defined during startup period (until end of July 2018), see above.

Once registered the amount of tokens given per month and accumulated if the minimum required utilization has not been achieved yet are fixed by this digital contract registered in the TF Chain. Even if the TF Ambassadors decide to change some of the parameters this will not have an impact on already registered TF farming pools.

If a TF farming pool gets unregistered e.g. because of 3 months breach of uptime then this contract becomes void.
