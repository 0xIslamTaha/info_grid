# Farm sizing questions

## Question
Are micro-farmers with single node installations at some disadvantage competing for usage of their capacity with nearby larger farms?

## Answer

Eventually, there will be 3 certification levels of capacity.

- DIY (Do It Yourself): individual farmers
- Managed: managed service providers who have access to the nodes (typically bigger players)
- Certified: Professional or Individual farmers

The micro farmer will be part of a chosen category and only published there (directory has distinction). Depending on the category there is a min price, so people cannot dump prices.

There are 3 types of capacity

- Compute (which includes mem & cpu & ssd capacity)
- Storage (HD or SSD capacity)
- Network (where to connect to the internet)

The TF Foundation will suggest prices for each certification levels in line with location e.g. home behind fiber, a commercial datacenter with multiple internet connections, telco POP, school/university/...with large bandwidth pipe, â€¦ The goal is to come up with the right ratio between price & achieved level of service. This will of course not happen over 1 day we will have to learn.

Some workloads will work everywhere e.g. the 3bots by themselves and we will have a lot of them. It makes a lot of sense to run a 3bot with micro-farmers, gives you lots of neutrality and there should be a price advantage.

Often there are different business models. E.g. a 60 Petabyte of archive in a serious swiss datacenter with super high-speed internet lines will position & price the capacity differently compared to the SOHO farmer with 1 node and 4 disks only.
