# How do you calculate the ROI in your TFT simulation?

It is very simple, lets; define the components of a Return of Investement:
* Investment: is all the costs you make at the beginning as one time payments: hardware, shipment, installation, initial system setup.
* Revenue: equals all the Farming and Cultivation tokens that you get as a farmer accumulated over the 60 months period.
* Operational cost: equals all the cost incurred over the 60 month period, not including the initial investment.

As ROI is calculated in a fiat currency and therefore all earned tokens need to be exchanged for fiat currency (or at least have a value expressed in fiat currency).  The ROI calculation is than as follows:


\frac{(Revenue Earned) - (Operational Cost)}{Investment}

 Note: Operational cost are covered by selling TFTs (Tokens)
