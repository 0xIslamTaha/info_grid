Cloud units are the way to account for capacity farmed and used.  They are the compute and storage equivalent to kWh - kilo watt hour - the unit of energy.

We utilise three categories of units:
- Compute Unit.  A compute unit represents a certain amount of data processoing power.  Data processing power is made up of cores (logical [CPU's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)) and RAM ([Random Access Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory))
- Storage Unit. A storage unit represents a certain size of data store at a certain access speed ([IOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS))
- Network Unit. A network unit is a representation of the amount of data that travels in and out of the acquired storage units
