# Farming Simulation Tools


[Farming Token Estimator](https://jscalc.io/calc/8jXXLOukrlXcI7H4)

**Inputs needed:**

- Number of logical cores: See your hardware specs
- Amount of memory in GB: See your hardware specs
- Amount of solid state disk (SSD) in GB: See your hardware specs
- Amount of disk storage (HDD) in GB: See your hardware specs
- Token price when capacity is listed in USD: Currently USD 0.12

[Cultivation Token Estimator](https://jscalc.io/calc/uWbIWOR0dynA46iU)

**Inputs needed:**

- Number of compute units (CU): Output from Farming Token Estimator
- Number of storage units (SU): Output from Farming Token Estimator
- Sale price for a compute unit [$]: USD 15.00 (until Grid usage start in Q2 2019)
- Sales price for a storage unit [$]: USD 10.00 (until Grid usage start in Q2 2019)
- Average usage over 5 years [%]: we use 60% (realistic medium usage)
- Price erosion over 5 years [%]: we use 20% (lower than industry as we are already mutiple times lower in pricing)
- Average Token price (5 years) [$]: we use in our calaculations USD 1.0

You can play around with the last three parameters to simulate differnt scenarios.

[ROI Calculator](https://jscalc.io/calc/7PSBwT4Io6rQ9Bog)

**Inputs needed:**

- Number of tokens farmed [TFT]: Output from Farming Token Estimator
- Number of tokens cultivated [TFT]: Output from Cultivation Token Estimator
- Average Token exit value [TFT]: we use USD 1.0
- Hardware cost: See your hardware offer price or invoice
- Monthly operational cost: get offer from colocation partner (includes: rackspace, power, connectivity)

You can play around with the average Token exit value to simulate different scenarios.
