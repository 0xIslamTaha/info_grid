## GIG Presentation Material

see all the masters in our [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IQLlHYB8YGFNkbtubkFt0mxjXAQ5R1k1?usp=sharing)

finished presentations are in : TODO !!!

## goal is 

- we make slidedecks in no other means then linking slides from the masters into the presentations we use in the field
- ALL content for TF is in this master folder and at no other place, other preso's only link to these slides

## Remarks

- the slides in the masters are not useful as is, they are just a collection of slides which can be linked too
- there is no structure nor flow in the master slides
- there is lots of duplication in the master slides
