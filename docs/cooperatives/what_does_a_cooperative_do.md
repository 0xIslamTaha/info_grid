# What does a cooperative do

![](../images/domore.png)

## Farmers can use cooperatives in multiple ways.

### Option 1. Investor Only Model For Managed Or Unmanaged Capacity (main usecase)

- Farmer goes to cooperative to understand model, benefits, potential ROI, ...
    - Cooperative will help to make right decisions
    - Cooperative is organizing training sessions as well.
- Farmer signs contract (generic contract which explains how it works).
    - framework agreement
    - need to do form of KYC in relation to amount of money which will be spent
    - could be different per location (tax, legal)
- Farmer buys Tokens and gets tokens in his digitalme wallet (digitalme wallet does not belong to us).
    - This is the investment done which can then be used to farm or just keep as tokens.
    - Legally: tokens are a prepayment (as stated in framework agreement) for future hardware or services
- Farmer makes selection on online tool (chat or web) and chose
    - sell only boxes in stock of our assembly partner e.g. 3s3
    - managed/unmanaged (new/refurb)
    - amount, size & configuration of the nodes
    - location of hosting for the hardware
    - if support is required for the endusers using the capacity (additional fee)
- Farmer will get detailed proposal/simulation
    - simulation of tokens (from farming, from cultivation)
    - amount of tokens required to purchase
    - monthly cost
- Farmer need to instruct his DigitalME that its ok the spend the required budget for this project.
    - maximum in relation to cooperative in relation to time
- A digital form of the contract will be created and digitally signed by both.
- At setup the cooperative will
    - send invoice to buyer
    - request the required tokens out of the digitalme
    - send instructions to partner to ship the box(es) to the right colo parties
    - make sure colo-parties install & connect the nodes
    - verify the nodes got online
    - make sure the nodes get registered in the TF Grid
- Each Month
    - The farmed/cultivated tokens will come to the cooperative which will forward to the digitalme wallet minus the monthly costs & commissions.
- Monthly the cooperative will
    - If there are not enough tokens farmed or cultivate for the monthly cost then the cooperative will request the required TFT's from the Farmers digitalme for bandwidth, colo & remote hands services.
    - If managed capacity the cooperative will deduct 20% of the sold tokens and send to GIG.
    - The cooperative will make sure colo parties get their tokens for their service
    -
- Every month the farmer gets a report about
    - uptime
    - tokes farmed / cultivated
    - free capacity
- Farmed & Cultivated tokens are always send to the digitalme wallet

### Option 2. Tech Farmer wants to buy nodes for unmanaged capacity

Farmer wants to host himself (connectivity/bandwidth)

- Farmer signs generic contract (generic contract which explains how it works).
- Farmer buys Tokens and gets tokens in his digitalme wallet.
    - This is the investment done which can then be used to farm or just keep as tokens.
- Farmer makes selection on online tool (chat or web) and choses
    - unmanaged (new)
    - amount, size & configuration of the nodes
- Farmer will get detailed proposal/simulation
    - simulation of tokens (from farming, from cultivation)
    - amount of tokens required to purchase
- The cooperative will
    - send invoice to buyer
    - request the required tokens out of the digitalme
    - send instructions to partner to ship the box(es) to the right Farmer
    - verify the nodes got online (little bit of support, to be defined)
    - make sure the nodes get registered in the TF Grid

- Project done & closed from out of Cooperatives perspective

### Option 3. Tech Farmer wants to buy nodes for managed capacity

- Only cooperatives who have an agreement with GIG can provide this service.
- see Investor Only Model till shipment of node.
- The Farmed & Cultivated tokens go to Cooperative each month.
- Cooperative will deduct GIG Commission 20% (is all automatic)
- Cooperative will deduct support fee if any

### Option 4. 100% Community driven

- all cooperatives do best effort on community tools

### Option 5. farmer has already the equipment unmanaged

- see 4.

### Option 6. farmer has already the equipment managed & big deal (???)

- custom deal with cooperative for support/setup/gig license/...

### Option 7. rent new managed farming nodes

- see #1 but is pure monthly fee

### Option 8. rent new unmanaged, refurbished farming nodes (not all coops will do this)

- see #1 but is pure monthly fee

## Typical margins

- margin on hardware (as defined by cooperative) + costs for logistics for the 3 models.
- +-5-10% for setup in case 1 (unless if special cases)
- fee for training & support (to be paid with tokens)

## Remarks

- Sell hardware (in stock normally) which allows a Farmer to farm on TF Grid.


## Product Selection

- hardware box
- colocation facility
- managed/unmanaged capacity


## Some principles

### A farmer needs to have a digitalme service

- this digitalme service will have multiple wallets integrated: BTC, ETH, TFT
- the famer allows his digitalme to make payments to cooperative or colo provider with certain maximum amounts.
- he originally bought tokens by farmer are send to his digitalme wallet
- the farmer can at any point in time transfer tokens in or out of this dm wallet.
